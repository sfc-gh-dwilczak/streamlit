    Use this app to query and view the metrics defined in your dbt project. It's important to note that this app assumes that you're using the new
    Semantic Layer, powered by [MetricFlow](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/about-metricflow).  The previous semantic layer used the `dbt_metrics`
    package, which has been deprecated and is no longer supported for `dbt-core>=1.6`.

    To get started, input your `JDBC_URL` below.  You can find this in your project settings when setting up the Semantic Layer.
    After hitting Enter, wait until a success message appears indicating that the application has successfully retrieved your project's metrics information.
